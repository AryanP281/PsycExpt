            <Typography variant="body1"> Thank you for participating in the study. The study is about the emotion of awe. We experience awe usually when we come across vast things or complex ideas. It's an overwhelming emotion that makes us feel small and puts us in touch with bigger concerns. Researchers in my field are trying to find the best method of studying awe. This study presented you with photos and narratives to understand how the two methods compare in their ability to produce awe. Photos represent the physical vastness whereas the narratives present complex ideas both of which can induce awe. I hypothesize that both would be equally likely to induce awe since research suggests that both the physical vastness and complex ideas can induce it. Similarly, people who experience awe in one modality also experience awe in other modalities. The latter half of the experiment was aimed at understanding you as a person. These questions tried to understand whether any of your traits or interests could affect my results. These ratings were related to personality traits (extraversion, openness to experience, neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness)  and your style of processing (whether you are a visual or a verbal processor). If you are interested in obtaining the results of the study or wish to have certain doubts clarified you can contact 7710035657 or email me at janeausten282@gmail.com. Your contribution is extremely valuable to my study as well as to the progress of my field.  </Typography>
